## WIP
Angular.js workout from the [South Bay Mobile User Group](http://www.meetup.com/South-Bay-Mobile-User-Group/events/219331949/)

## grunt
* look through the gruntfile and you'll basically get it... you define tasks and register them.

## jasmine
* `beforeEach` and `afterEach` are setUp and tearDown methods
* disable a test by prepending an x before describe or it
* specs inside a disabled suite are not ran
* main test is in `test/spec/controllers/main.js`
